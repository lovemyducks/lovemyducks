We finished classes  
And graduated AMT  
So much has changed now  
While some things did not  

The obvious change is no more classes  
That means no sitting down for hours  
listening to teachers all day long  
No more homework or having to read  
I'm glad school is over  
It was all good stuff  
just took up so much time each day  
And got long by the end of it all  

We used to have morning devotionals  
Early in the morning before breakfast  
Usually lead by a staff member  
They had so many good messages  
That I'm not complaining we had them  
It's just nice to have that time now  
to have my own personal devotional  
I really struggled to find time before  
With everything else that I had to do  

We used to have set work schedule  
Were we were either on dinner prep  
Or dishes and meal clean ups  
Thing is it didn't matter  
which two of us were on cleanup  
Because we all pitched in anyway  
Now that we graduated  
There's a sign up for work things  
And so the staff now helps out  
But we still all help with cleanup  
It's just nice I'm not required to  
do dinner prep every night  
for two weeks straight  

We get full time Wi-Fi  
Before it was 2 hours  
at a set time at night  
Every other day  
I found it difficult to get on it  
Because Hope was crazy before bed  
Or usually I was tired by than  
And many times it was hard to connect  
It's really nice now  
Being able to use it whenever I can  
And it's easier to get a hold of people  
When my internet is more flexible  

What I am happy about  
Is I get to have Hope all day long  
And not have a babysitter  
It was good for Hope to get used to  
somebody else watching her  
And she's going to be babysat more  
as she grows up in her life   
But I enjoy taking care of her while I can  
For she's so much fun and adorable  
So I'll be thankful for these moments  
Even though it's harder to do things  
when she's wanting so much  

The first week after graduation  
Some of the guys took a trip to the city  
to pick up a car that they had tried to sell  
Reece went with as an adventure  
And to spend more time with the others   
While he was gone I took care of Hope   
And moved some bricks with Richard   
We could have waited and just rested   
But it was good work and we had fun   
I liked the change from the class setting   
into a working labor job each day   

First week after graduating AMT   
was rather relaxing for me    
Even with the full time watching Hope   
the moving of bricks,   
the washing of clothes and diapers   
the continued work on cleanup   
And keeping our room clean with a baby   
who loves to throw everything around   
These things are easy and fun for me   
And I am not so rushed as before   

I like having time to   
to write in my notebooks and to God   
and emails, newsletters, and papers   
I feal now that I can listen to music   
There's time to hangout or talk to friends   
I didn't realize till after   
everythings slowed down   
how hard it was to have time to think   
We did a lot of learning   
And my brain was always thinking   
But I had unfinished thoughts   
That I had set aside   
till I could really think about them   

Advanced Mission Training was great   
And it pushed me to be flexible   
with crowed schedules   
For 3 months it was intense  
and almost overwhelming with a baby   
But I'm glad we did it   

Life likes to test what we can handle   
And what we place our value in   
No matter what ends up happening   
whether good or not so good   
We should be found at the feet of Jesus   
He's the bestest comforter and teacher   

If you want something be worth it   
Give it to God   
Whether that be working   
or watching a movie   
or listening to music   
or going overseas to do AMT   
Take it before God   
and see what He has to say about it   
He's an expert at finding good in things   

So AMT is over   
And we all are waiting for   
when we'll be coming home   
During this time   
let us not forget the reason for it all   
I came all the way to Mozambique   
With my husband and my daughter   
Not so that everything would be   
easy and relaxing   
But because I longer to find out   
what vision God would have for our lives   

There's something that's very important   
And I want us all to remember   
The cost of following Jesus   
is Never to much   
He is Always worth it;   
Whatever we sacrifice   
in order to follow Him   
will be better in the end   

That's why through all of AMT   
With all its time struggles   
And the months of separation   
from family and friends   
I can still be grateful   
God was here with us   
Making our sacrifice with it   
   
We Love you all   
And want you to always know   
God Loves you too   

Love
