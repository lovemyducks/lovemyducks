Hey everybody from Mozambique  
We are doing well  
And pray and believe you all are as well

We were asked the question  
If we were going to choose to stay  
In Mozambique and finish our course  
Or leave and have to come back to finish  
The reason they ask us this  
Is because there is a chance  
We may not be able to leave on time  
They are shutting down the planes soon  
And if we don't go now  
it's uncertain when they be flying again

We decided to take the risk and stay  
Chances are we'll be leaving on time  
We feel no need to worry  
But even if we get stuck here  
a bit longer than we planned  
It's all still going to be okay

God knew we were going to be here  
And that the world was closing off  
He didn't stop us from coming  
And it's His will for us to be here  
So why would we leave early?  
God is with us here  
And it's in God will we're safest  
Besides our Heavenly Father has a plan  
and we're excited to see what He'll do

We Love you  
And want to see you again  
We know God's watching over you  
So be patient till we come back  
And know that will be worth the wait  
how ever long that may be

Love  
Harmony*
