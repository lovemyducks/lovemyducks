We finished our Advanced Missions Training!!   
After 3 months of crowded schedules   
With all the homework and class time   
We finally graduated the course   
   
The question that we had to decide   
Was what was out next step   
Were we going to return to our home   
And stay living in the states   
Or were we going to join Overland   
And move to another country?   
Either way we'd never be the same   
Life at AMT has taught us things   
that we'll keep for the rest of our lives   
   
I said it was up to us to decide   
And that's basically true   
We asked God for His plan   
And He is the one we follow   
Whatever He says goes   
So whether He told us to go or stay   
He would be the definite decider   

Now Jesus didn't speak a word to us   
On what path we should take   
Which it's pretty nice when He does   
Though we didn't get a direct command   
on what we should or shouldn't do   
We were filled with a longing      
to go into the world   
to tell the lost about Jesus   

Going through our training for AMT   
We got a taste of what it would be like   
to live on the mission field   
We'd have to go up to people   
and talk to them about Jesus   
We'd have to fundraise   
We'd have to write to people back home   
We'd stay in tents at times   
We'd have to do some bush cooking   
We'd have to fix our car ourselves lots of times   
We'd be far away from family and friends   
We'd have to go without lots of stuff   
such as we couldn't have lots of clothes   
Or many toys, notebooks, possessions   
There's only so much one can pack   
When going to another country   

It takes sacrifice   
In order to become a missionary   
But God Blesses the willingness   
to follow Him no matter the cost   
Overland is full of these types of people   
who want to share the Good news with the world   

Reece and I are continuing on with Overland   
We'll be going to Zambia to live   
and we get to reach out to the rural areas   
to places other mission organizations won't go to   
We may not have gotten a loud calling from God   
but His passion is within us   
That's why we are willing to sacrifice all we have   
the comforts of home and the familiarities there   
and the often of seeing our Loved ones   
We know His Love for His people   
and His heart is crying out for them   
Who will go tell them He Loves them?   
We will!!!!   

Before we leave for Africa to live   
we'll be back for a while raising funds   
Don't feel that you've lost us forever   
and know we'll stay in touch and visit still   
This is something to reJoice about   
For we are following Jesus as He's called us to   
There's nothing we could do that's greater   

We Love you   
Stay strong in His Love  

Love  
Harmony*
