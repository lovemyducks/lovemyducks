“This world has nothing for me, you are all I need!” These words from the song “Poverty nor Riches” by Ghost Ship, have become an anthem of sorts for me. It’s an excellent song. Give it a listen. Jesus is all I need. The truth of that statement is wonderful. It’s so freeing. He isn’t simply all I need to feel good. To feel happy. To have a purpose in life. He’s all I need to know.

>	1 Corinthians 2:2 “For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.” 

I know a little about a lot of things and a lot about a few things. The only thing I need to know is “Jesus Christ and him crucified.” Nothing else. There is no knowledge greater and more useful than this. It’s so thrilling when my understanding of this is deepened. I need the truth of Jesus Christ closer than my bones, flowing within my blood, yet constantly present on my tongue. The only words worth saying are those which proclaim His glory. The only things worth doing are those which display His love. I can’t point a finger at the time in which I came to these conclusions. However, upon realizing I had concluded these things, I came to another conclusion. That is, there is nothing else I would rather be doing. 

When I was a child, I absolutely loved early American history. Manifest Destiny, pioneering, living on the frontier. Reading of those who forged a path into the unknown has always lit a fire in my belly. Those days are over though. The greatest unexplored frontier these days is the ocean floor, but that’s because we’re not fish. I grew up wishing I had been born in another time, a time when I could blaze a trail across the plains. I thought this desire to pioneer was something broken in me and wondered why God had made me with it. I had no idea it was something He intended to use. He brought me to Overland Missions, an organization focused on pioneering the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the unreached people of the world. He showed me that He is the reason for that fire in my belly, and He has given that same desire to others. I cannot help but throw my hat in the ring and join them in their mission to pioneer the gospel.
	
The Lord has brought me here, and He propels me forward. I dare not tarry long, lest I lose sight of His everlasting glory.
