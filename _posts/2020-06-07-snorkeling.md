For our graduation ceremony     
The staff to us on a boat ride   
We road on a pontoon with two floors   
And it had a place where we could Braai   

As we sailed the ocean   
We saw thousands of starfish   
There were also many sea urchins   
Some flamingoes and crabs   
While snorkeling we even saw lion fish   
It was mine and Reece's first time   
ever using a snorkeling   
And it was very cool   

We parked on an island   
Where Hope got to go swimming   
And she went around picking up starfish   
We even collected some shells   
Which I thought was kinda silly before   

Than for dinner we had a big meal   
It was our special graduation dinner   
They used the Braai to cook the meat   
We ate while the sun set on the ocean   

It was a very nice experience   
And I see why people go scuba diving   
The ocean is so cool   

I had only been to the ocean in Florida   
Where the beaches are crowded   
And the wild life is not easy to find   
Where the shells have all been
picked through or are badly broken   
So I had never really experienced   
Many of the wonders of the ocean   
which God filled with such beauty   
and so much creativity   

It was a good time on the boat   
And we shared it with all our new friends   
They are even more so gifts from God   
He created them with even more beauty   
that the ocean isn't able to top   

I don't know if you all   
have been to an ocean   
Or if you've ever experienced it's wild life   
It doesn't really matter all that much   
Because in the end what really changes   
The ocean is great   
But it's not as wonderful as people are   
   
You have Loved ones the cherish   
They're worth more than the ocean   
Don't forget what matters   
Because things of this world fade away   
And beauty can only do so much   
   
God gave us all people we can befriend   
I know trusting someone can be tough   
But if we don't let them inside our hearts   
How will we truely understand   
the beauty and worth   
God made them to be?   
   
If I had never gone to the ocean   
How would I have seen its full beauty   
Is the same with friends   
We have got to know   
what true friend are like   
Than we'll be thankful for them   
And not need to go far   
to see God's handy work   
      
This newsletter was different   
But hopefully you got something out of it   
If not, at least know this thing   
I'm grateful for you   
And id rather spend my days with you   
Than the wonders of this works   
Because I agree people are what matter   
   
God made you special   
Remember you are beautiful   
And I Love you very much   
   
Love
