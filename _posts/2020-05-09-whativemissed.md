Last night we had burritos  
And I realized how much I've missed  
eating tortilla shells  
I used to eat them everyday  
With leftovers or whatever inside them  
But that's not the only thing I've missed  

I've missed my pets  
our dog Sarge and Milo our cat  
I've missed having pizza  
and the dipping it in yogurt  
I've missed going to work  
because I enjoyed my bosses  
I've missed my notebooks  
since I couldn't take them all with me  
I've missed the hills at my parents  
where I have spent so much time  
just hanging out with God  
I've missed being up to date  
on new music from my favorite bands  
I've missed my phone that has  
a working camera  
I've missed the cold weather  
I've missed having a bathtub  
I've missed my NIV Bible with my marking  
I've missed collecting pennies  
I've missed organizing crazy messes  

But of course most of all  
I've missed the people back home  

I've missed being with my family  
I've missed talking to my grampa  
and every morning having breakfast with him  
I've missed playing Barbie's with my sisters and younger brothers  
I've missed listening to music with Bonnie  
I've missed watching shows with Gracie  
Or watching Netflix with Andrew  
I've missed playing Freecol with Willie  
I've missed talking about our superheros with Bonnie Willie Gracie Faith and Andrew  
I've missed organizing with Faith  
I've missed cleaning with Bonnie  
I've missed helping my mom  
and cleaning to bless her  
and make her smile  
I've missed taking my siblings shopping  
so they can help me pick out groceries  
but also so I can spoil them  
I've missed listening to Tommy  
I've missed Hopper's excitement  
and his crazy enthusiasm  
I've missed church with my family  

I've missed going to Daniel's house  
and just hanging out with him and Miranda  
we'd watch movies, eat good food, play board games or Nintendo, and have fun teasing around and talking  

I've missed going over to my in-laws  
and seeing all of them  
I would go to their house, and it was a place I could call one of my homes. They Loved me as part of their family, and we bonded just like we always were a family.  
I've missed My sister in-law Ellyse  
for she is somebody special. She is talented and so tenderhearted, that I'm thrilled to get to do things with her. She is good with Hope, and likes to hear stories about what Hope's learning and how she's growing up. I've missed Ellyse and it's enjoyable to do anything with her.  

I've missed more than just my family  
I've missed my friends too  

I've missed  Amber and her family  
She and I liked being together. No matter what we had to do, we had a good time. We worked together and helped another with house chores. We would go grocery shopping together, which was nice because kids can be difficult in a store alone. Our kids would play together, while we talked about life, our challenges and what God was teaching us. I've missed her heart for me, and she truly showed me God's Love.  
I've missed getting our families together for games, and  

I've missed Holly  
and going over to her house  
We used to get together about once a week before I was married, and we had so many adventures. We also had bible studies and discussions which helped me by having somebody believe in my Faith. Here at AMT we learn about discipleship, and she is to thank for a lot of my living out my faith.  

I've missed many people  
And I'm sorry if anyone feels left out  
because I didn't mention your name  
My encouragement to everyone  
is that you do some reflecting  
on what is special in your life  
You don't have to go away  
and live in another country  
in order to realize what you'd miss  
God's Blessed us all with so much  
that we should easily be thankful for  

I want you also to know  
That I don't regret coming to Africa  
Though there are things I miss  
And people I can't wait to see again  
I am content because of God  
I am able to go without what I miss  
Because Living for Jesus is worth it  

From me and my family here  
We send you our Love and Joy  

Love  
Harmony*
