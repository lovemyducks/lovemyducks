Bush Cooking week was a long one\
We had our day filled with classes\
than we had to bush cooking for supper\
I'm glad we did it\
But also is nice to be done

So we had bush cooking\
And I am not a fan of cooking\
It was great fun\
as long as I wasn't trying to cook\
The time we got to spend together\
was what made it the best\
We cooked up a large fish\
And a freshly prepared chicken\
which a fellow teammate got to kill

The last night of bush cooking\
We cooked around a campfire\
and the guys camped outside\
Hope and I hung out with the team\
But at bed time slept indoors\
We had great fellowship\
And we grew to be better friends\
We look after each other\
We share in the work\
We also chat on our breaks

This is just some of our adventures\
That we've had in Mozambique\
We've been learning new things\
But most importantly\
we've been growing in our friendships\
Since there are only two other students\
here with us for AMT\
We get a lot of time together\
And really help each other out

Through all life's adventures\
We're to be growing in our relationships\
Those around us are there for a reason\
And we need to see that God Loves them

Love

Harmony*
