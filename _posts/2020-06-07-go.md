The Great Commission:  
Go into all the world  
Preaching the Gospel to all creations  
Making disciples of every nation  

Whether we go to far off countries  
Or stay living in our home town  
Each of us is called to Go!  
To go tell the world about Jesus  
And what He's done for us and them  
Go Love somebody  
by telling them the truth in Love  
Because they are Loved by God  
Just as much as He Loves you  
Once we know His heart for the world  
How can we forget that He told us to Go  

I like songs
============
They stir up passions within me  
And get me thinking and motivated  
There are many song out there  
that are all about how we're called to Go  
Here's a small list of my favorites  
If you are similar me and like songs  
I hope these speak to you  
And fill you with strength

Don't feal like you have to  
listen to them all  
Because I got carried away  
I put many suggestions down  
They are listed there  
So that you can see what bands I like  
And maybe in glancing over then  
you see a song you think you'd like  
Or find one you already know  
but forgot about  
If not that's okay too  
I created this list so that I can have it   
And listen to them on my way home  
I don't mind if it's realized   
that I am crazy when it comes to music  
It was excited to share songs with you  
Because it's what I enjoy doing  

Thankyou all for listening  
And don't be to distracted  
by the many songs I suggested  
  
Love
