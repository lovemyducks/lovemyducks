After being here 2ish months  
There's some things I would change  
when it comes to deciding what to bring  
And what I actually would pack  

Things I should have brought 
==================

- Family pictures to show our new friends what the people I talk about look like

- American candies to share with everyone, such as Swedish fish and jelly beans because they are treasured here and they wouldn't have taken up much room

- More Ziploc bags, because they break and get used for whatever

- More pens, both colored and black

- More things to entertain Hope because she gets bored sometimes

- A babysitter, but not really. I got a native sitter for some of the time, but I'd rather watch Hope myself. It would have been cool to have brought a sister, and Hope would have liked that better, but it's just not practical.

Things I wished I hadn't of packed
======================

- Warm clothes, because it doesn't gets cool enough here to need sleeves or pants

- Shoes, because I and Hope don't wear them, all I would have needed were my flip flops for shopping and hot sand, and the plane ride here

Things we brought and I'm very grateful that we did, and why
====================

- Duck tape for everything

- Rubber bands as a baby toy but also I use them for everything

- Salt and pepper shakers, because they were little plastic Tupperware containers that we use to make frozen yogurt treats for Hope

- Sewing kit, which we use to get slivers out. Also lent it to someone so they could sew a button back on, and a single needle was used to find the direction of north in a navigation lesson

- Cloth diapers, makes having a baby in a different country cheaper and more delightful in my opinion

- Shampoo, commonly used to get stains out of Hope's Clothes

We had a lot of decisions to make  
When if came to packing  
I found packing for Hope  
took up a lot of our space  
And we had to only pack necessities  

The cool thing about God is  
He makes what we brought be enough  
And we aren't suffering without  
All that we packed works out  
And though we can imagine changes  
The truth of the matter is  
God blessed our packing  
We have what we need  
And aren't missing anything  
that we can't get here if needed be  

God is good  
In bible times He provided manna  
And that fed everyone just right  
Nobody had too little or too much  
This is how works  
Whatever we have it's just right  
when God is blessing it  
So we can relax in Him  
Knowing it's all going to be okay  
This is for more than just packing  
Everything we do can be God Blessed  
Because God Loves us  
He fed 5000 men with 5 loaves  
and 2 small fish  
He's powerful enough to take  
what each of us have to give  
And He makes it be the right amount  
Lacking nothing and having plenty  

The world likes to tells us  
we should have done things differently  
It says we don't have enough  
God like to use what we have  
And He is all we really need  
What good is it to own the whole world  
if you don't have Jesus?  
When you have Jesus  
what more can the world give  
that you need?  

Let me tell you  
Jesus is enough  
He's what each of us need in our lives  
And He'll take care of all other needs  
Believing this will cast out fear  
Because there is comfort in knowing  
your Heavenly Father is with you  
providing you with all the right things  

Love from Mozambique  
And Love from God in Heaven  
We haven't forgotten about you  
Even though I am away from you  
I trust God to be with you  

Love  
Harmony*
